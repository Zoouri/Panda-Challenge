    "* In conclusion, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better results in academic achievements. Surprisingly, schools with higher spending per student underperformed more than those with lower capita expenditure.\n",
    "* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools significantly outperformed larger schools based on math score, reading score and overall passing score.\n",
    "* Overall, Independent Schools exhibited a higher level of academic success in comparison to the Government institutes across all metrics. However, further analysis would be requried to establish whether this difference is due to resources available or teacher-to-student ratio; when comparing data it was evident that there is a vast difference in sizing of private setups compared to government schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset limitations:\n",
    "Upon viewing the data, I observed an imbalance, with 8 Independent Schools compared to 7 Government Schools. Ideally, for a fair comparison, an equal amount of data for each school type would be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a notable difference in the size of the government schools. For a more equitable analysis, it would ne beneficial to generate insights based on an equal number of students and their achievements. This approach could offer more in-depth analysis, as average scored and overall passing percentages might be more sensitive to fluctuations when based ona  lower number of students, with a single poor result potentially exerting more influence on the overall academic success rate."
